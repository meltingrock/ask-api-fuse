# How to Build and Install Python Module Locally

Prerequisites:
- Python 3.x installed
- pip installed
- Poetry installed (pip install poetry)

Method 1: Build and Install from Wheel/Distribution
1. Navigate to project's Python directory:
cd ./py

2. Build the package using Poetry:
poetry build

3. Install the built package using pip:
# Install from wheel (recommended)
pip install dist/*.whl
# OR install from source distribution
pip install dist/*.tar.gz

Method 2: Direct Installation with Poetry
1. Navigate to project's Python directory:
cd ./py

2. Install in current environment:
poetry install
# OR create new virtual environment and install:
poetry shell  # Creates and activates new venv
poetry install

Development Installation (Editable Mode):
pip install -e .

Troubleshooting:
- If permission errors occur, use a virtual environment
- Ensure you're in correct directory with pyproject.toml
- Clean old builds before rebuilding:
rm -rf dist/ build/ *.egg-info

Verify Installation:
python -c "import your_module_name; print(your_module_name.__version__)"
