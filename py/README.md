# About
FUSE (RAG to Riches) is the most advanced AI retrieval system, supporting Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with production-ready features. Built around a containerized RESTful API, FUSE offers multimodal content ingestion, hybrid search functionality, knowledge graphs, and comprehensive user and document management.

For a more complete view of FUSE, check out the [full documentation](https://fuse-docs.sciphi.ai/).


## Key Features
- [**üìÅ Multimodal Ingestion**](https://fuse-docs.sciphi.ai/documentation/documents): Support for over 26 files types, including `.txt`, `.pdf`, `.json`, `.png`, `.mp3`, and more.
- [**üîç Hybrid Search**](https://fuse-docs.sciphi.ai/documentation/hybrid-search): Combine semantic and keyword search with reciprocal rank fusion for enhanced relevancy.
- [**üîó Knowledge Graphs**](https://fuse-docs.sciphi.ai/cookbooks/graphs): Automatically extract entities and relationships, build knowledge graphs, and run GraphRAG.
- [**üóÇÔ∏è User Management**](https://fuse-docs.sciphi.ai/self-hosting/user-auth): Efficiently manage documents and user roles within FUSE.
- [**üî≠ Observability**](https://fuse-docs.sciphi.ai/self-hosting/observability): Observe and analyze your RAG engine performance.
- [**üß© Configuration**](https://fuse-docs.sciphi.ai/self-hosting/configuration/overview): Setup your application using intuitive configuration files.
- [**üñ•Ô∏è Dashboard**](https://github.com/SciPhi-AI/FUSE-Application): An open-source React+Next.js admin dashboard to interact with FUSE via GUI.


## Getting Started

### [SciPhi Cloud](https://app.sciphi.ai)

Access FUSE through a deployment managed by the SciPhi team, which includes a generous free-tier. No credit card required.

## Self Hosting

Install FUSE:

```bash
# Install the FUSE package
pip install fuse

# Set necessary environment variables
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...

# Run the server and database
fuse serve --docker --full
```

The command above will install the `full` installation which includes Hatchet for orchestration and Unstructured.io for parsing.
